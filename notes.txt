notes
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 -d -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home jenkins/jenkins:lts
then run docker logs to find admin pass for jenkins

then add a multibranch pipeline job
discover branches filter all by regexpression
build config leave default: build by jenkins file

add credentials, because jenkins wants creds to access github
    add system and global creds
then got to job -> credentials, and add credentials - this is for job

add branches to discover: ^develop|master$

add jenkinsfile, now declarative,, not scripting

you can replay your jenkinsfile for every branch

Scan Multibranch Pipeline Triggers - for scan scm changes periodically
